## Installation

1. Install Home Assistant on your target system https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/
2. Install HACS https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/
3. Add this Repo to HACS by going to the 3 dots on the right ...-> Custom repositories ->
 Repository: `SunStrong-Management/pvs-hass` Category: `Integration`
4. Install this integration in HACS searching for `PVS` (using the latest release is recommended)
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "PVS".
   * The main configuration is `<IP/Hostname>[:port]`. Check your router configuration for the IP of your PVS


## Options (available from 'configure' once integration is setup)

### Data update interval (seconds)

This sets how fast the integration will try to get updated info from the PVS.


## Devices

### Gateway

This is the data from the PVS Gateway device. These sensors provide diagnostic and usage information about the gateway itself.

## Debugging

### Installed through HACS but I can't find it in the integrations list

Some people seem to have a browser caching / refresh issue it seems to be solved by completely
clearing caches or using another browser.
